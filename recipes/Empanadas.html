        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Add onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato sauce, olives, sofrito, sazón, garlic, oregano, and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll empanada disks on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch larger in diameter. Spoon about 1 tablespoon meat mixture into the middle of each disk. Moisten the disk edges with water, fold in half over filling to form a half-moon, and pinch to seal (or seal with a fork).</li>
            <li>Heat 2 1/2 inches corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Working in batches, fry empanadas until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to paper towels to drain. Enjoy!</li>
